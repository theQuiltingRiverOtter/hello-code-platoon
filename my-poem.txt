Once upon a midnight dreary
While I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping
suddenly, there came a tapping
as of someone gently rapping
rapping at my chamber door
Tis some visitor I muttered
rapping at my chamber door, 
only this and nothing more
